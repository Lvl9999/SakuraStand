# Emulator Hub:
### A script hub exclusive for Sakura Stand! (For now :3).

## Main Hub Source:

**Requirements:**
#### Info: When you are in a private server or a low server a better autofarm plays.
- (For Public Servers): The Black Silence (Using it will enable risky autofarm prob bannable).
- (For Private Servers): Vampirism / Standless / Shadow The World + The Intelligent (U must have the title).
##### Tip: You should use Vampirism because he works the best!
```lua
getgenv().ToggleUI = "J"-- //  Key Toggle "J" set by default however you can change it.
getgenv().EmulatorHub = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/EmulatorHub";

pcall(function()
    loadstring(game:HttpGet(getgenv().EmulatorHub))();
end)
```

##  OA Farmer Source:

**Requirements:**
- Standless + Mastery 3 + Empty Stand Slots.
##### Tip: Put in your autoexec and use it in public (Undetected).
```lua
getgenv().GrindingOA = true --// Determinds if the script will run or not (false/true).
 
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/OAgrinder"))();
```

## Tokens To Cash Convertor Source:

**Requirements:**
- 500 Tokens + The Rich + The Intelligent.
##### Tip: You should use this on 2x Weekends!
```lua
getgenv().AutoT4C = true -- // Determinds if all the tasks will run or not (false/true), You dont have to set everything else to false if u want to stop completely just set this false.
getgenv().HowManyTimesT4C = 2 -- // Determines how many times to convert T2C | 2 = 130,400 Cash (Set number high if your cash capacity is higher).
getgenv().AutoBreakthrough = true -- // Will breakthrough you.
getgenv().AutoUpgradeMastery = true -- // Will upgrade mastery for you.
getgenv().AutoBuyAndSellRokakaka = true -- // Will buy rokakaka and sell it along with every item.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/TokensToCash"))();
```

## Glitcher Source:

**Requirements:**
- Standless (Just grab someone with Barrage or Counter attack).
##### Reminder: If you get caught you get banned :3
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/Glitcher"))();
```

## Statistics GUI Source:
**What does it do???**
- It displays your summed up gains (Cash,Token,Mastery) in a GUI.
##### Tip: Divide how many masteries you got by 15 to see how much breakthroughs you gained.
```lua
getgenv().StatisticsGUI = "V" -- //  Key Toggle "V" set by default however you can change it.

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/StatisticsGUI"))();
```

## Custom Script Pack:
##### This is what I personally use :3
```lua
getgenv().ToggleUI = "J"-- //  Key Toggle "J" set by default however you can change it.
getgenv().StatisticsGUI = "V" -- //  Key Toggle "V" set by default however you can change it.
getgenv().EmulatorHub = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/EmulatorHub";

loadstring(game:HttpGet(getgenv().EmulatorHub))();loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/StatisticsGUI"))();
```
