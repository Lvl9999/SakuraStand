# Sakura Hub ðŸŒ¸
### A Script hub exclusively for Sakura Stand!

## Sakura Hub's Loadstring:

#### When you are in a private server or a public server a diffrent autofarm plays.
- (For Private Servers): Shadow The World / Standless / Shinra Kusakabe (U must have the spec).
- (For Public Servers): Nothing, It wont autofarm Mobs in public (For your Safety).
##### Tip: You should use Shinra Kusakabe because he works the best!
```lua
getgenv().ToggleUI = "J" -- //  Key Toggle "J" set by default however you can change it.
getgenv().SakuraHub = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand/main/SakuraHub";

pcall(function()
    loadstring(game:HttpGet(getgenv().SakuraHub))();
end)
```
- #### Selling for 750 Robux an even faster autofarm (15 masteries in 4-5 minutes).
- #### Also selling god mode for 350 Robux, Dm meh discord if interested :3

- #### I also made a script for The Strongest Battlegrounds. I recommend you to check it out! [Here](https://github.com/Lvl9999/TheStrongestBattlegrounds)
